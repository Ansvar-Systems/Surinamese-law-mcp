# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under Surinamese bar association rules.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Risks:**
- Queries through Claude API flow via Anthropic cloud infrastructure
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Surinamese professional conduct rules (Surinaamse Orde van Advocaten — SOA) require strict client confidentiality and data processing controls

**Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **Local npm Package**: Install `@ansvar/surinamese-law-mcp` locally — database queries stay on your machine
3. **Remote Endpoint**: Vercel Streamable HTTP endpoint — queries transit Vercel infrastructure
4. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with AI clients:

```
User Query -> MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Cursor/API) -> Anthropic Cloud -> MCP Server -> Database
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Local npm Package (Most Private)

```bash
npx @ansvar/surinamese-law-mcp
```

- Database is local SQLite file on your machine
- No data transmitted to external servers (except to AI client for LLM processing)
- Full control over data at rest

#### 2. Remote Endpoint (Vercel)

```
Endpoint: https://surinamese-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp
```

- Queries transit Vercel infrastructure
- Tool responses return through the same path
- Subject to Vercel's privacy policy

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through an AI client:

- **Query Text**: Your search queries and tool parameters
- **Tool Responses**: Statutory text (wetteksten), provision content, search results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, request identifiers

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (depends on AI client configuration)

## Professional Obligations (Suriname)

### Surinaamse Orde van Advocaten (SOA)

Advocaten (attorneys) in Suriname are regulated by the **Surinaamse Orde van Advocaten (SOA)** under the Advocatenwet. Key obligations when using AI tools:

#### Geheimhoudingsplicht (Duty of Confidentiality)

- All client communications are confidential under Surinamese professional conduct rules
- Client identity may itself be confidential in sensitive matters
- Case strategy and legal analysis are protected
- Information that could identify clients or matters must be safeguarded
- Breach of professional secrecy may result in disciplinary proceedings (tuchtprocedure) before the SOA

### Data Protection in Suriname

Suriname has adopted data protection legislation based on internationally recognized principles. When handling client personal data through AI tools:

- You bear responsibility for ensuring client data is not exposed to unauthorized third parties
- International data transfers (e.g., to US-based Anthropic) should be evaluated for compliance with applicable data protection requirements
- Consult the SOA and relevant Surinamese authorities for current data protection obligations

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### LOW RISK: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through any deployment:**

```
Example: "What does artikel 1365 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek Suriname say about unlawful acts?"
```

- No client identity involved
- No case-specific facts
- Publicly available legal information

### MEDIUM RISK: Anonymized Queries

**Use with caution:**

```
Example: "What are the penalties for corruptie under Surinamese criminal law?"
```

- Query pattern may reveal the nature of a matter you are working on
- Anthropic/Vercel logs may link queries to your API key

### HIGH RISK: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through cloud AI services:**

- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use the local npm package with a self-hosted LLM
- Or consult official sources (dna.sr, Staatsblad) directly

## Recommendations

### For Solo Practitioners / Small Firms (Individuele Advocaten / Kleine Kantoren)

1. Use local npm package for maximum privacy
2. General research: Cloud AI is acceptable for non-client queries
3. Client matters: Consult official Staatsblad publications and qualified local counsel

### For Large Firms / Corporate Legal (Grote Kantoren / Juridische Afdelingen)

1. Negotiate Data Processing Agreements with AI service providers before any client data is transmitted
2. Consider on-premise deployment with self-hosted LLM
3. Train staff on safe vs. unsafe query patterns

### For Government / Public Sector (Overheid / Publieke Sector)

1. Use self-hosted deployment, no external APIs
2. Follow Surinamese government IT security requirements
3. Air-gapped option available for sensitive matters
